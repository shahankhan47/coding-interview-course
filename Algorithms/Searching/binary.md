- Binary Search works only with sorted arrays.
- Divide and conquer approach.
- Start from middle. Divide the list in half from middle.
- If the middle element is lower, discard the left left otherwise discard the right list.
- Repeat and the item will be found.
- Complexity: O(log n)

- Both tree and graph traversal use breadth first search and depth first search (BFS and DFS)

BFS:
Pros:
- Good at finding shortest path.
- Nodes are closer

Cons:
More memory

DFS:
Pros:
- Less memory
- Does a path exist? from a source node to a target node.

Cons:
Can get slow
