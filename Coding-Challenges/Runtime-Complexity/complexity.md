# Constant Time:
1 - no matter the input, the algorithm will always take same amount of time to complete.

# Logarithmic Time:
log(n) - Doubling the input doesn't double the amount of time. Search operations are log(n)

# Linear Time:
n - Amount of time is directly in correlation with the input. E.g. loops.

# Quasi-linear Time:
n * log(n) - Doubling the input doesn't double the amount of time. Sorting operations are n*log(n).

# Quadratic Time:
n ^ 2 - Every element in collection has to be compared with every other element. E.g. Handshake problem

# Exponential Time
2 ^ n - If adding a new element in the algorithm doubles the processing time/power.
