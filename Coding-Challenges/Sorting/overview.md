In algorithms, sorting usually implies arranging an array of numbers increasing or decreasing.

Bubble Sort - O(n^2) - easiest - not efficient - good for small dataset.
Selection Sort - O(n^2) - easier - not efficient - good for small dataset.
Merge Sort - O(n*log(n)) - medium - more efficient. - good for large dataset.
