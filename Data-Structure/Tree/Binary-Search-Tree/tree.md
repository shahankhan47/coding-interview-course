Binary Search Tree or BST has only two children in a node.
The left child has always has a value that is less than the parent. (Parent.value > leftChild.value).
The right child always has a value that is less than the parent. (Parent.value < rightChild.value).

Binary Search Tree is not the same as Binary Tree.
A Binary Tree like BST has just 2 children for a node but does not conform to the other 2 criteria.
