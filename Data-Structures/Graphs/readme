Great data structure to model real world relationships.

Linked Lists are a types of tree.
Trees are a type of graph.

Graphs are the most useful data structures in real life.

Contains edges and vertices(nodes).
Information can be stored in both edges and vertices.

Types of graph:
- Directed : Go from one node to another node in one direction.
    E.g. Instagram Following. You follow someone but that person not necessarity follows you.
- Undirected : Go back and forth between any node(s).
    E.g. Facebook friends. When 2 people become add each other, they both follow and become friends.
- Weighted Graph : Edges also contain information.
- Unweighted graph : Edges do not contain information.
- Cyclic : Nodes are connected in circular way.
- Acyclic : Nodes are not connected in circular way.

Pros:
Relationships

Cons:
SCaling is very difficult.
