- Each child value is less than the parent.
- Less ordered than Binary Search Tree.
- No order from left to right.

Uses:
- Great at doing comparative operations.
- Used a lot in data storage, priority queues and sorting algorithms

Big O:
- lookup    - O(n)
- insert    - O(log n)
- delete    - O(log n)

FYI - Javascript memory heap not equal to heap data structure.


Pros:
- Better than O(n)
- Priority
- Flexible Size
- Fast Insert

Cons:
- Slow lookup
