##  What is a data-structure?
A.  A data-structure is a way for us to organize our data.
    Analogy would be a school bag for books, refrigerator for food, drawer/closet for clothes, etc
    Each designed for a specific purpose so that we can retrive data easily.
    Strings, Numbers, Objects, Arrays, etc are all data-structure.

##  Integer Ranges
8 bit - 255
16 bit - 65,536
32 bit - 2,148,483,647
64 bit - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

Very large numbers in JS is stored as Infinity
Math.pow(6, 1000) = Infinity

## Types of DS:
- Arrays    - Trees     - Stacks    - Tries      - Graphs     - Queues     - Linked Lists       - Hash Tables

## Types of Algorithms
- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion

## Operations on DS:
- Insertion     - Deletion      - Traversal     - Sorting       - Searching     - Access
