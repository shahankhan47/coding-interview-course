Interview Trick:
For string related questions, convert the string into an array, do operations and then convert it back into string.
Treat string related questions as array related questions.

Arrays are good for:
- Fast lookups
- Fast push/pop
- Ordered

Bad for:
- Insertion/Deletion
- Fixed size bottleneck if using static arrays.
